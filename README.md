# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
A Neural Network machine learning model, in particular a multi-layer perceptron, created and trained against a randomly generated data set.
Packages used in this project were Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.
Matplotlib is a Python package used to model and visualize data.
Scikit-Learn is a Python package used to create various machine learning models along with performing supplemental functions and calculations involved in machine learning.
